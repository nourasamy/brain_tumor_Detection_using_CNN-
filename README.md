# brain_tumor_Detection_using_CNN-
Brain Tumor detection Attached a dataset for Brain MRI images “brain_tumor_dataset.tar.gz”. These images divided into two directories yes, no . Where yes directory contains brain MRI images that have a positive Tumor and no directory contains brain MRI images that doesn’t have such Tumor. It’s required from you to use that dataset and utilize your knowledge with CNN to create a model that detect if the brain MRI image has tumor or not. You need to implement two different network architecture. the first one must have input layer that accept input of size 128x128 and the second model input layer should accept input of size 32x32.
